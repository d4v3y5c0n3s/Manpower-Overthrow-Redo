# Manpower Overthrow Redo
### I'm working on a remake of a game that I made with a friend for a game jam.
## Notes:
### I'm using GCC to auto-generate the bindings to Allegro.  This works fine most of the time, but the generation does have hiccups that require manual fixing.  Usually if there is a problem it can be fixed by removing the "limited" keyword and/or adding a "use" declaration to fix visibility issues.
